		<h4>Bio:</h4>

		<p id="special">
			I am a girl who codes from Charlotte, NC. I will be in a senior in my master’s program in the fall, and I am looking forward to applying for jobs. I live at home with my mom, my brothers, and my dog named Milki. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music with my friends or reading.

			<h4>Likes:</h4> I love a great science fiction novel. Right now I am reading The Three Body Problem, by Cixin Liu.

			<h4>Dislikes:</h4> I really don’t like snakes. They have dead skin that freak me out!

			Last week, I build a cool side scroller project in Scratch. To build it, I learned about storyboarding, graphic design and using the concepts of functions, loops, conditionals, and variables. Check out the screenshot below!
